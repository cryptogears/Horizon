o Don't store every pixbuf in memory forever.

o Implement replying to threads

o Make the code pretty 
  o Application is getting beefy again, so its probably time to factor
    out all that widget stuff.
  o ImageFetcher is a blight. I think it would be best templated so
    that one could easily plug in Glib/libev/libevent, as well as
    custom writeback function/request struct.

o Make the interface pretty

o Think about dropping pixbuf refptrs when threads are closed.

o Implement Save-thread-to target directory

o Implement a slideshow mode. 

o Even after ImageFetcher doesn't use Glib for eventing, I suspect
  there will still be freezes when we call show_all() on a new 500
  post thread. There should be a way to show a couple widgets, then
  iterate on the main loop.
  o I tried using a Dispatcher but there's still a hang somewhere.xse
