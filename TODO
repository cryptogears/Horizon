o Even after ImageFetcher doesn't use Glib for eventing, I suspect
  there will still be freezes when we call show_all() on a new 500
  post thread. There should be a way to show a couple widgets, then
  iterate on the main loop.

o Save all downloaded images to disk, like XDG_cache_dir or
  whatever. When "save-to" is implemented, we'll just ln or cp.
  o in the cache metadata, keep track of how often and whatnot each
    image is posted.

o Implement replying to threads

o Fix the gVim bug

o Make the code pretty 
  o Application is getting beefy again, so its probably time to factor
    out all that widget stuff.
  o ImageFetcher is a blight. I think it would be best templated so
    that one could easily plug in Glib/libev/libevent, as well as
    custom writeback function/request struct.

o Make the interface pretty

o Think about dropping pixbuf refptrs when threads are closed.

o Implement Save-thread-to target directory

o Implement a slideshow mode.
