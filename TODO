o Implement replying to threads

o Make the code pretty 
  o Application is getting beefy again, so its probably time to factor
    out all that widget stuff.
  o ImageFetcher is a blight. I think it would be best templated so
    that one could easily plug in Glib/libev/libevent, as well as
    custom writeback function/request struct.

o Make the interface pretty

o Implement Save-thread-to target directory

o Implement a slideshow mode.
